Many tools exist to search a Git repository for potentially sensitive information. Each of these may have different capabilities and use different detection methods.

Here is a curated list of the secret detection tools we've come across:

| Name                  | URL                                                            | Installs Pre-Commit Hook? | Supported by `watcher` | Description                                                                                                           |
